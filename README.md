# ⚡ Next.js 16 Starter Template

A minimal and clean starter template with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Prettier and the React Compiler.

This template is for those who, like me, are tired of setting up a new project from scratch every time they have a new idea. It includes all the essentials I always use to get you up and running in no time.

## Features

- 🚀 **Next.js 16:** The latest version of the popular React framework.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with typography plugin.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode:** Built-in dark mode support with next-themes and system preference detection.
- ✨ **shadcn/ui:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components.
- 🪄 **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter to ensure consistent code style. It's configured with `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` to automatically organize imports and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to sort Tailwind CSS classes.
- 🤖 **React Compiler:** An experimental compiler that optimizes your React code.
- ✅ **ESLint for React Compiler:** ESLint is configured with `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` to enforce the rules of hooks and other React best practices with the compiler in mind.
- 🖼️ **Lucide Icons:** A beautiful and consistent icon set.
